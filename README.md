# Development-Project---Malware-Detection
This is my final year project which detects and labels malicious links in mailing services like gmail

While the process is pretty straight forward, we just have to run 'Main.py',
Howeveer there are a few things we need to do to that.

1. link a gmail account which has been google authenticated by OAuth 2.0 to Access Google API.
-put the gmail ID in the 'username' variable and OAuth code in 'password'.

2. Set the file paths for RandomForest and ExtraTreeClassifier as 'model_path_rf' and 'model_path_etf'.

And that's it.

Documentation regarding the tests done are in the 'TESTS' folder.
